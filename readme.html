==========

Define the domain.
------------------
We would like to create a solution for anyone to generate a layout design quickly and easily.
This language is specific to layout design and will not be expanded to other general purpose problems.

Define the problem. What is the purpose of the language?
--------------------------------------------------------
It is time consuming, tedious, error prone, and not easily repeatable to make posters and bulletins that
are professional, dynamic, and consistent. We would like to create a language that allows users to easily 
generate graphical solutions that overcome these problems and meet these standards. There are also quite 
a lot of people that aren't proficient in design, and could greatly benefit from a tool that assists them 
in the creational of a professional layout.

Create example "solutions". What is the expected output for some examples of valid input?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the user specifies how they want their poster attributes (headings, columns, images, fonts, etc.) 
to look, the output file will consist of HTML and CSS, and the user will also have the option to generate 
a PDF of their poster or bulletin. 

Define functionality. How is the output determined for a given input?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
We will define certain grammar that represents different poster attributes for the purpose of creating 
properly formatted output files. The parser will parse our input based on predefined structures from our 
grammar. The translator will do most of the work, because it will convert our code into something that 
can be displayed on a webpage or PDF.

Talk with the professor, and get approval.
